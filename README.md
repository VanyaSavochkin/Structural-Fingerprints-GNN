# Structural-Fingerprints-GNN
#The main code to train the model, generate fingerprints and cluster them can be found in the full workflow file.
#In order to run this code you will need two folders containing the supercells for the materials.
#The supercells can be generated by runnning the reduced_sublattice_structure.txt through one of the supercell generator code cells (the bottom cell is the most recent).
#The graph generators file consists numerous code cells correpsonding to different variations of graph representations (generally the higher code cells are more recent).
